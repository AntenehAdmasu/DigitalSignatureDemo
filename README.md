# DigitalSignatureDemo

This repo is created to submit digital signature demonstration assignment for the course Fundamentals of IT Security.

Using this desktop app, one can send files with digital signatures and the receiver can check its data integrity by verifying the signature.
BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll files should be added to references for crypto libraries.
